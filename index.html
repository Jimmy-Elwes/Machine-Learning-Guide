							<h3>About Me</h3>
						</header>
						<div class="content">

							<h4>My Life so far</h4>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/nice.jpg" alt="" /></span>Hi, I’m Jimmy Elwes, an aspiring entrepreneur and data enthusiast on a quest to use technology to tackle real-world challenges. My journey through the tech world has armed me with a variety of skills in data analysis, marketing strategy, and product development. I’m on a mission to turn these skills into impactful solutions that make a difference.</p>
							<p>My academic adventure began at a university in Nottingham, UK, where I dabbled in mechanical engineering. Despite my enthusiasm for engines and numbers, I soon discovered that engineering wasn’t quite the thrilling ride I had hoped for. Sure, building things was fun, but it turned out that my favorite part was more about pretending to be a mechanic than actually being an engineer. So, I packed up and headed back to London to find a new path.</p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/gammapic.jpeg" alt="" /></span>I kicked off my professional career in Telecoms at Gamma, where I discovered my love for coding. I found that coding had a satisfying, tangible output, reminiscent of the problem-solving aspect of my engineering studies that I enjoyed the most. However, let’s be honest—Telecoms was as exciting as watching paint dry. I’m grateful for the skills I gained but escaping that tech corner felt like breaking out of a particularly boring escape room. Now, I’m diving into opportunities that are far more thrilling and a lot less mind-numbing, which led me to the nonprofit sector with the CEC.</p>
							<p>At CEC, I found a sense of purpose and excitement. Whether presenting to charities or chatting with students about their career prospects, I felt truly connected to my work. The projects were inspiring, and I relished the creative freedom within the team. Yet, I hit a ceiling and was itching for a new challenge.</p>
							<p>To level up my skills, I tackled a data science course that sharpened my Python abilities, boosted my data modeling know-how, and refreshed my statistics skills. This was a key step in my journey, equipping me with the essential tools for my next adventure.</p>
							<p>Then, out of the blue, Miniclip—a company I had grown up with—offered me a chance to work with them. Diving into the gaming industry was a blast, tracking everything from goals scored to ball possession durations. It was an exhilarating experience, but my dream of relocating to the USA with my American partner became a reality.</p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/welcome_image.JPG" alt="" /></span>Moving to the USA has been quite the transition, but the opportunities here are as vast as the country itself. Despite some British skepticism about American culture, I find its energy and ambition genuinely contagious. I think it says more about the British mindset than it does about the American, but I will say the food is better in London than in New York, apart from the pizza that is genuinely the best in the world, and no, I am not talking about Pie or Fish and Chips or of course baked beans…</p>
							<p></span>Now while working on my master’s in finance, I’m also keeping my coding skills sharp through personal projects. I’ve built a <a href="https://www.fpldatamerchant.com/" target="_blank">Website</a> to improve my fantasy football team (Premier League), showcasing some cool visualizations and machine-learning models to predict player points. I’m also diving into app development with Flutter, and you can check out my projects on <a href="https://github.com/Jimmy-Elwes" target="_blank">Github</a></p>
							<h4>Outside of Data</h4>

								<span class="image right">
									<img src="images/fpldatamerchant_pp.jpeg" alt="FPL Data Merchant"/>
								</span>
							</a>When I’m not coding, I’m passionate about team sports like football, rugby, and kickboxing. My love for sports is reflected in my projects, which often focus on sports data analysis. If you’ve got a sports-related idea or a collaboration in mind, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or through this site.</p>
							<p>I’m also a cinephile with a deep love for cinema. <a href="https://letterboxd.com/jimbo_flick/" target="_blank">Check out my Letterboxd account</a> to see my film reviews and connect with me. As an AMC A-List member, I’ve seen a wide range of films—some fantastic, and others, well, let’s just say they were more memorable for their “unique” qualities (yes, I’m looking at you, “Imaginary” and that haunted pool movie). I’m always on the lookout for ways to enhance my film-watching experience and would love to chat with fellow movie buffs.</p>
							<p>Feel free to drop me a line if you’re interested in collaborating or just want to discuss sports, movies, or the latest data trends.</p>
